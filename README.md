# business-requirements-document


# The purpose of the project is to address the existing gap in the market for effective training of students preparing for their driving tests at the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The client, Driver Pass, aims to provide comprehensive driver training through a system that offers online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training. I believe the strength I showcased was with my UML diagrams.

# If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, I would revise the technical requirements and define them better. It is important to incorporate a user's needs when designing because, at the end of the day, we want our client to be happy, and we want the product to fit the service they are providing. My approach to designing software is to have an agile approach where I can revise and revisit sections of the software as needed.
